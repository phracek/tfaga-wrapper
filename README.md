### Software Collections Organization's wrapper for Testing Farm as a GitHub Action

This wrapper tries to minimize lines of code needed to be written in each
container repository when calling TFaGA.
This should lead to code reduction, duplicity removal,
easier maintaining and adding features.

This action is currently usable only for issue comment trigger.
